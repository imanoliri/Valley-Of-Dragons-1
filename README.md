# InteractiveBook
This is an application that lets you create an interactive book (website) from a static book.

## Minimum Viable Product - 1
Python script that takes an HTML book, divide it into chapters, and generate a static HTML file with tabs for each chapter. This script uses BeautifulSoup to parse the original HTML and jinja2 to create the static HTML with tabs. Additionally, add extra contents accesible from a new __"Contents"__ tab:
- Fully automatic from story:
    - Click images in order of the story.
    - Memory with images from the story.
    - Word cloud (word sizes by frequency).
    - Anagrams from word salad.
    - Fill in random words in a paragraph of the story.

- Standard, unrelated to story:
    - Sudoku.
    
- Manual:
    - Battle games.

It also has a "Story Feedback" tab that allows the reader to give feedback for the whole story as well as each chapter.
