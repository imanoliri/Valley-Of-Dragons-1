Welcome to Durin's Chasm! Deep of the mountain, the dwarves mine in search of the gold, gems and stone. Unfortunately, they discover a nest of goblins and retreat to the fort at Durin's Chasm to defend from the invasion.<br><br>
        
The goblins will try to cross the chasm using the three bridges in beige. The mountain dwarves and an ally dragon rider (green team) must work together to repell the attack of the goblin invaders (orange).<br><br>

Optional victory condition: don't let a goblin unit stay more than two consecutive turns on any of the towers.<br><br>

Hardcore victory condition: don't let a goblin unit step at the other side of the bridges.
