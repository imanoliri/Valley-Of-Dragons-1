Welcome to Broken Shard Passage! In dire need to break the stalemate in the war against the goblins, the dwarven army decides to perform daring move â€”a section of the army feints an attack over a chasm, while another traverses the mysterious Broken Shard Passage to surround the distracted enemy and crush them.<br><br>

Nevertheless, the goblins decide that attacking section is inferior to them and respond with a ferocious counterattack! Lead your flanking group (green) through the Broken Shard Passage and defeat the enemy (orange) before they annihilate your brothers (purple)!<br><br>

Use your commanding Dragon Rider to lead the attack of the flanking group (green), while defending the bridges with your engaged group (purple) to avoid being overrun. Beware, for the goblins have Trolls!<br><br>

Optional victory condition: don't let your Dragon Rider die.<br><br>

Hardcore victory condition: don't let any enemy unit cross the bridges.
