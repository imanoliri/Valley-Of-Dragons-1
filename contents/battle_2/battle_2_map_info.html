Welcome to Greystone Pass! The evil Lich King's army is marching towards the Valley of Dragons and all efforts to stop them by the Order of the Dragon Knights have been in vain.<br><br>

Gather your knights at the Greystone Pass and ambush the advancing army before they can reach castle Tarn. Don't let more than 5 enemy units reach the south end of the map! Protect your knights in the peaks (light grey) and attack where the enemy is most vulnerable. Beware of the Lich King, because it can cast deadly ranged magic attacks!<br><br>

Optional victory condition: don't let more than 3 units (apart from the Lich King) reach the south end of the map.<br><br>

Hardcore victory condition: don't let any enemy unit other than the Lich King reach the south end of the map.
