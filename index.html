        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.nhisysmozijl"><span class="c7">Chapter 1: Valley of Dragons</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Once upon a time, humans, dragons and elves lived in peace in the Valley of the Dragons. These three races had very different gifts but shared a deep respect for each other. The dragons, with shimmering scales and wings that sparkled like sunlight on water, were the first to arrive. Ancient, wise, and fierce, they lived close to nature and nested in the high mountain caves overlooking the valley. From these heights, they soared above the land, watching over it like guardians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Centuries after the dragons came, the elves arrived, graceful and wise. They built elegant cities in the forest, blending magic with nature so that trees grew into homes, and plants wove themselves into doors and windows. The elves cherished beauty and knowledge, spending lifetimes perfecting both. Their songs, filled with enchantment, drifted through the forest like whispers on the wind. They were experts in magic and art, but also fiercely skilled in combat, training tirelessly to be ready if ever needed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, humans arrived in the valley, bringing with them a different kind of magic—creativity and resourcefulness. They built small towns along the rivers and plains, weaving tight-knit communities. Humans were quick to adapt, creating new tools, trading with one another, and mastering crafts that brought prosperity to their settlements. While they could not live as long as the dragons or elves, their courage and industrious spirit made them an essential part of the valley’s life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Together, the three races learned to share their knowledge. The dragons would tell tales of distant lands beyond the valley’s mountains, the elves shared their understanding of magic and the natural world, and the humans introduced new crafts and ideas that enriched everyone’s lives. Through each other, they grew and thrived, each race’s unique qualities creating a balance in the valley that everybody cherished.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The valley was full of laughter, trade, and the vibrant glow of magic shared among friends. This was a place where anyone, young or old, could look to the mountains, see a dragon gliding peacefully across the sky, and feel a sense of wonder and belonging. In the Valley of Dragons, the world felt safe.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image26.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 312.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/></div>

From beyond the mountains came the Dark God, a being of terrible power. No one knew where he came from or why he sought to destroy the valley. Only the elves, with their ancient knowledge, had heard whispers of him in the form of old, cryptic songs warning of his dark ambitions. Now, those warnings had become reality.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image23.jpg" style="width: 576.00px; height: 385.63px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span>Among the army of the dark god there were goblins and orcs, which formed the lower ranks, undead and necromancers in the middle ranks and gargoyles and demons in their highest ranks.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image15.jpg" style="width: 249.60px; height: 215.42px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="Skeleton | Forgotten Realms Wiki | Fandom" src="images/image17.jpg" style="width: 185.00px; height: 240.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="Demon | Villains Wiki | Fandom" src="images/image12.jpg" style="width: 176.95px; height: 230.40px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span>In the face of war, the elves formed the noble order of the dragon rider knights, who were experts in the use of both weapons and magic. They were led by 3 paladins of exceptional valor named Gawain, Percival and Galahad. Gawain's dragon was a great silver one named Alderyth, Percival’s was green and named Mythral whereas Galahad’s was red and called Tyradon.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 270.42px; height: 384.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 270.42px; height: 384.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/></span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 270.42px; height: 384.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="" src="images/image21.jpg" style="width: 328.32px; height: 172.85px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 328.32px; height: 205.68px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Before the elves and dragons could organize a defense, many villages fell to the invaders, reduced to smoldering ruins. Among the victims was the peaceful village where a 2-year-old boy named Alaric lived. By the time the dragon riders arrived, the dark forces had already torn through Alaric’s home, and his family was gone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the aftermath of the battle, Gawain found Alaric, the only survivor among the ruins, miraculously unharmed. The paladin took him in his arms and flew him to a neighboring town, where young Alaric was adopted by a kind family who vowed to raise him as their own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And so, while the valley mourned its losses, hope flickered in the hearts of the people. Though much of the valley lay in ruin, the order of the dragon riders, led by the three noble paladins, stood strong. The elves, with their knowledge and magic, and the dragons, with their fierce power, joined forces as protectors of the valley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Alaric’s story had just begun, shaped by the terrible events of that day. Though he was too young to fully understand the tragedy, the memory of the Dark God’s army and the sight of dragon riders soaring through the smoke would stay with him forever. He would grow up with the knowledge that, one day, he too might have to fight to protect the valley from the darkness.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.des2e4owi6pr"><span class="c7">Chapter 3: Alaric</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After the initial wave of attacks was driven back by the dragon riders, the valley regained a sense of fragile peace. Though forever changed by the shadow of war, life slowly returned to normal for the surviving towns. The dragon riders patrolled the skies, vigilant against further threats, and the people rebuilt their homes, working together with quiet resilience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric, now growing up in his new family’s care, was a gentle, curious boy. Though his adoptive family had never hidden the truth of his past, he felt deeply connected to them, and they treated him as one of their own. His adoptive father taught him the value of hard work and honesty, while his siblings became his closest friends. Life was simple yet fulfilling, and Alaric took part in every chore and activity, from tending to the animals to helping his mother in the garden.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he grew older, Alaric became a handsome, athletic young man. He was good-natured and generous, never shying away from hard work but also knowing how to enjoy life. His warm personality made him well-liked in the village and earned him a close circle of friends.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image33.jpg" style="width: 384.00px; height: 384.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But even in these peaceful days, the war was never far from their minds. Dragon riders could often be seen patrolling overhead, their massive forms gliding gracefully across the sky, a constant reminder of the ongoing battle against the dark forces beyond the valley. Sometimes, Alaric would hear the distant clash of wings in battle, or see human caravans from the river cities passing through town, carrying weapons, supplies, and armor to reinforce the defenders.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric and his friends would run to the tavern whenever these travelers arrived, eager to listen to stories of bravery and valor. He would sit wide-eyed as the caravaners told tales of fierce battles at the valley’s borders, of dragon riders descending in waves to push back dark creatures from the mountains. They would speak of the order’s three great paladins—Gawain, Percival, and Galahad—each with a tale of incredible courage. These stories filled Alaric with awe, stirring a growing desire in him to help defend the valley someday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric’s days were happy, yet there was a quiet determination growing in him that few noticed. Though he could barely remember his birth parents or the village he had lost, the memory of the destruction he had narrowly survived stayed with him. Whenever he thought of the Dark God’s forces, a resolve hardened within him—a desire not for revenge, but to protect his loved ones and ensure that no one else would suffer as he had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Years passed, and the valley watched Alaric grow from a child into a strong, dedicated young man. His friends admired his hard work and joked that he had the heart of a warrior, though he would laugh and shrug it off. Though he still enjoyed simple pleasures—wandering in the fields, spending time with friends, and listening to tales of adventure—his thoughts often drifted to the dragon riders and the noble order that protected them all. One day, he knew he would join them and do whatever it took to protect the valley that had given him a second chance at life.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.28hpdrnyo2u0"><span class="c7">Chapter 4: The Decision</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As Alaric grew older, he felt a stirring in his heart, one that seemed to call him toward something greater. Though he had a happy life with his adoptive family, the tales of the dragon riders’ bravery and the fierce battles against the Dark God haunted his thoughts. Alaric often wondered if he was meant for something beyond his simple life in the village. The memory of the night his village was destroyed, though hazy, always flickered in the back of his mind, fueling his sense of responsibility to protect those he loved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">On his sixteenth birthday, after a day filled with laughter, good food, and stories around the fire, Alaric found himself awake and alone under the vast sky. He watched the stars and thought about his life, his family, and the valley he cherished. As he looked up, he spotted the silhouette of a dragon rider patrolling far above, majestic and vigilant against the night sky. In that moment, he knew what he had to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following morning, Alaric spoke with his family. He explained his desire to join the dragon riders, to fight for the valley and defend it from the darkness that threatened to engulf it. His parents listened in silence, their faces thoughtful. Though they had always known he was destined for a different path, the reality of his decision weighed heavily on them. They feared for his safety, but they also understood his sense of purpose and courage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Alaric,” his father said, resting a hand on his shoulder, “we are proud of you, more than you can know. We have raised you as our own, and we have watched you grow into a fine young man. If this is your choice, we will not stand in your way. Just remember that we will always be here, waiting for your safe return.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric’s mother, though tearful, embraced him tightly, whispering, “Stay true to yourself, Alaric. You have a good heart. Let that guide you.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With his family’s blessing, Alaric began his journey. He knew he had much to learn before he could become a dragon rider. Though brave, he was still inexperienced, and he would need to prove himself before being accepted by the knights who guarded the valley. For now, he set his sights on the river cities, where he could work, save money, and perhaps find a mentor who could prepare him for the journey ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he walked through the fields and past the edge of his village, memories flooded his mind—of childhood games, of nights spent by the fire with his family, and of friends who had become like brothers and sisters to him. He promised himself he would return one day, stronger and more capable, ready to defend the home he loved.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">His path would be long and filled with challenges, but Alaric felt a newfound strength within him, a determination that had been growing quietly all these years. With each step, he felt the pull of destiny, guiding him toward a future he could not yet see but was willing to fight for.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And so, with a final look back at the place he called home, Alaric left his village, ready to become more than a boy from the valley. He was ready to become a defender of his people, even if the road would be difficult and uncertain.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.uwbbfc81w4vm"><span class="c7">Chapter 5: River City</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At first, Alaric took on simple work, joining a merchant caravan as a porter and dogmaster. The job was hard, carrying supplies from the river docks to the markets, but it allowed him to earn a small wage and learn more about the world beyond his village. He visited the most important human cities in the valley and his fellow caravaners told him all there was to know about them.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image35.jpg" style="width: 595.20px; height: 400.58px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The most influential ones were the river cities. The Rhyvall river, flowing from the distant mountains, served as the main artery for transporting stone, timber, and metals from the highland mines and forests down to the bustling river cities. These centrally located hubs transformed raw resources into valuable goods, with artisans forging tools, farming implements, clothing, books and other specialized goods destined for the plains and farmlands. In return, the fertile grasslands sent harvests of grain, meat, and other staples back to the cities. While many valley families were largely self-sustaining, the cities themselves depended on the outer regions for food, producing only limited fresh items like eggs, dairy, and vegetables in city gardens. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After a few months with the caravans, Alaric saved enough to settle in the bustling river city of Riventhorn, where he hoped to find more stable work.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image20.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 312.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">There, he worked for food and a bed as an apprentice of a blacksmith named Brom. He was a man of few words and not especially friendly, but he taught him well. Alaric spent many months learning the trade and helped make horseshoes, nails, scissors, rings, locks and other common items. By the end, he could make these items on his own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After he had learned all he could from the blacksmith, Alaric left and looked for a proper job. He found weaponsmithing especially interesting and had to convince a master weaponsmith named Torric to let him work for him. It was agreed that the first year would be half the salary, due to Alaric’s inexperience with weapons. There he learned how to make spears, daggers, crossbows, hunting bows, warbows, shields, armor of leather, mail and plate and, occasionally, even swords. Now he was a productive and self-sufficient citizen that worked an honest and valuable trade.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image11.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 312.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He decided to visit the city’s temple to ask for counsel on the next step to take. The low-level priest was delighted to hear from such a noble and selfless mission and took him to his superior, the wise high priest Igorion. He in turn commended his spirit and told him that the city’s god Valerion was pleased by his mission. Nevertheless, Kordran was a more appropriate deity for his matters. He recommended a pilgrimage to his pantheon in the city of Silverdale to seek guidance.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When he arrived after 2 weeks of reflection and pilgrimage he told one of the local priests about his mission. The priest thought about it for a minute and told him to come again the next morning. Then he connected Alaric with elf plantsmith Eloran from a nearby elven city who visited the temple that morning to pray for his retired dragon rider knight uncle. The priest never really explained how he knew that Eloran would show up that morning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The two traveled together to Eloran’s forest home, and along the way, Eloran was young for an elf (only 120 years old) and shared stories of his uncle, a dragon rider who had once protected the valley. Eloran was amused by Alaric’s dreams of joining the order, yet impressed by his dedication and willingness to learn.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And so, with the guidance of a new friend, Alaric continued his journey, each step taking him closer to the path of the dragon riders.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.1a00voz4uff"><span class="c7">Chapter 6: Forest City</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric’s journey with Eloran took him deep into the forest, where the elven city lay hidden among towering trees. As they approached the elven city, Alaric marveled at its beauty. Unlike the human cities with their stone buildings, the elven city seemed to be one with the forest, with homes woven from living trees and lanterns glowing like stars. Trees had been carefully shaped over centuries to create homes and walkways, their branches twisting and curling to form graceful structures. Bridges spanned between tree trunks, winding paths connected different parts of the city, and lanterns, glowing with a soft, natural light, hung from the branches, casting the forest in an enchanting glow.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image34.jpg" style="width: 528.00px; height: 351.65px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The sounds of the forest merged with the faint notes of elven music, creating a melody that seemed to hum through the trees themselves. Alaric was struck by how different the city felt compared to the river towns he’d known; it was as if the city were alive, breathing and growing in harmony with the elves who called it home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When they reached the limits of the city, Eloran requested that the guards send a messenger to the palace, summoning the council of the Dragon Rider Order and the Elven Queen herself. The council members, cautious yet intrigued by Alaric’s intentions, listened closely to his request.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After deliberating, the Queen and the council saw promise in his determination. They ordered that Alaric be trained under the watchful guidance of Eloran’s uncle, Eryndor—a retired Dragon Rider Knight known for his wisdom and patience. As Alaric prepared to begin his training, he could hardly believe his luck. Soon he would embark on the journey he had dreamed of, under the careful instruction of one of the valley’s most revered warriors.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image30.jpg" style="width: 537.60px; height: 250.23px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Eloran led Alaric through the city and introduced him to his uncle, the retired dragon rider knight, Eryndor. Eryndor was a tall, elegant elf with silver hair and a quiet, intense presence. Though age had softened his face, his movements were swift and precise, hinting at the strength and discipline he’d maintained over centuries. Alaric felt both awe and respect as he stood before him, knowing he was in the presence of a warrior who had once flown with dragons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>After listening to Alaric’s story, Eryndor agreed to train him. He saw something in the young human’s eyes—a determination he respected. It was decided that Alaric would live with Eloran, learning plantsmithing during the mornings and training with Eryndor each afternoon. Eloran was patient, teaching Alaric how to shape trees and grow plants into useful forms, like tables, chairs, and even small shelters. </span><span>Plantsmithing</span><span class="c1"> was a delicate skill, requiring patience and focus, and it challenged Alaric to think in entirely new ways.</span></p><span>After listening to Alaric’s story, Eryndor agreed to train him.

He trained him in sword fighting, agility, and the art of balance. Eryndor was strict but fair, pushing Alaric to reach his limits while maintaining a steady sense of discipline. At first, Alaric struggled with the rigorous routines and the elven methods of combat, which required not only strength but also precision and flexibility. But he persevered, driven by his dream of joining the order and protecting the valley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One evening, while they rested after a long day of training, Eryndor shared a rare story of his own dragon, Seralyn. Seralyn had been fierce yet loyal, a creature of fire and strength who had fallen in battle years ago. Alaric saw a flicker of sadness in Eryndor’s eyes as he spoke, realizing how deep the bond between a dragon and its rider truly was. He knew that becoming a dragon rider would require not only skill but also a heart strong enough to form such a connection.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric’s time in the elven city taught him more than he had ever imagined. He learned to respect the quiet power of the forest, to shape it with patience, and to train his body and mind with unyielding dedication. His days were filled with hard work, and his nights often with reflection under the elven stars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>With each passing day, Alaric grew stronger, not only in skill but also in spirit. Though he was still far from becoming a dragon rider, he felt that he was on the right path, with new friends and mentors who believed in his dream. And in the calm of the forest city, he prepared himself for the challenges that awaited him beyond its serene beauty.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.yuufus8uco42"><span class="c7">Chapter 7: Battle of Greystone Pass</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">After completing his training, Alaric met with the council of the Dragon Knight Order. Impressed by his dedication, past accomplishments, and the apparent blessing god Kordran himself to lead him to them, they assigned him as squire to the renowned knight Kael. He was very welcoming and patient with him. He understood that he was given the task to help Alaric in his mission, as much as Alaric was to help him as his servant. The squire helped with equipment, training, logistics, traveling to battle and healing the wounds. Due to his experience he often repaired equipment. He became good friends with the other squires, which were elves, young and enthusiastic just like him, and were really interested in Alaric. They spent a lot of time together while their master knights patrolled the sky. But they also helped in battles as messengers, observers and distributing supplies in landing zones for the knights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One day, a big army led by the lich king Mortag amassed outside of the valley. The former human king had been raised by the dark god’s spell and he himself was a powerful sorcerer now. The dragon riders were taken by surprise by his ferocious army and powerful spells and couldn’t contain him outside of the valley. Paladin Gawain himself led the group of 7 knights, to which Kael belonged, to reinforce the defense of a pass into the valley. That was the first time Alaric had seen Gawain after the meeting with the council some years ago. The knights' helpers worked hastily in castle Tarn while the dragon riders gathered in the main hall for a final prayer before battle. A total of 40 dragon rider knights were present at the valley, which was almost all of them. Paladin Gawain and paladin Percival commanded the army of knights and had devised the strategy for the battle.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 288.08px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the lich king’s undead army arrived, the knights ambushed him in the deepest point of the pass. They attacked from all directions, letting themselves fall like hawks, strafing the undead army with fire and lance and soaring back up to cover themselves with the peaks of the mountains from the sorcerer’s lightning bolts. They were doing moderate damage to the army as well as slowing it down, but more importantly, they were draining the magic powers from their evil commander. Their strategy worked as intended: eventually Mortag slowed down his spells to a minimum and the dragon rider knights could be more aggressive. Once in a while a lightning bolt from the lich king sniped a dragon rider to ground or he would surprise them with a new spell, for example when he created a long ice tunnel to protect his army for a short while.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image24.jpg" style="width: 508.80px; height: 342.97px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Despite the knights’ efforts, the invading army was numerous and it eventually reached castle Tarn. Alaric and the squires and the human soldiers shot arrows, ballista bolts and onager rocks at the army but the terrain was more open and the skeleton archers could defend themselves better. The dark army was being whittled down by the knights but each time they committed an error, they paid dearly.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image25.jpg" style="width: 508.80px; height: 379.72px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">At last, the undead breached the castle gates, storming the two front towers with their remaining forces. The defenders regrouped within the keep and rear towers for a final defense. The Lich King himself entered the castle’s inner ward, summoning a storm of magical hail that forced the knights to dismount and fight on foot. Gawain and Percival ordered the knights to take up arms within the keep, and Alaric joined them, standing resolutely beside his master Kael.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The enemies broke into the hall and the clash soon turned into chaos. Although the knights were the superior fighters, the undead were more numerous and it was going to be a close fight. Alaric could see his side gaining the upper hand, but then he noticed the Lich King charging a spell, aimed at a trio of knights locked in combat with skeleton warriors. Acting quickly, Alaric cried out a warning, dashed through the fray, and charged at the Lich King with his sword. Though his blade didn’t hurt the enemy, he made him miss with his ice orb and saved the knights from a direct hit. The Lich King turned his cold gaze on Alaric, swiftly disarming him with his long ice sword and then stabbing Alaric in his abdomen. The chill of the enchanted blade weakened him, yet Alaric managed to lift his shield just before collapsing. Seeing Alaric’s courage, the knights came running to his aid – only the last enemies remained. Gawain and Percival confronted the lich king two on one and, with a masterful show of swordsmanship, they gracefully defeated the evil undead king. Victory was theirs.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image22.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 435.82px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span>Gawain had seen what Alaric had done. He came to him, kneeled over the squire, put his right hand on his wound and casted a healing spell, purging the chill from the Lich King’s sword. The battle was finished and the battered Alaric would survive his wounds.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Some days after the battle, the Order held a celebration to honor the fallen and commend those who had fought bravely. Songs and poems celebrating the most important feats (like Alaric’s brave intervention) immortalized the battle, adding a new chapter to the chronicles as “The War of the Lich King.” The knights and squires rejoiced in the celebration of the victory. Many men were awarded new ranks and merits. Among the honors given, Alaric was knighted as the first human Dragon Rider Knight!</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image28.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="" src="images/image18.jpg" style="width: 291.84px; height: 389.27px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.xfksn4tanj2o"><span class="c7">Chapter 8: Champion</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the years following the “War of the Lich King,” the dragon rider knights faced a difficult time. The order had lost fourteen of its sixty knights, and many squires had been injured or worse. With their numbers depleted, recruiting and training became the highest priority. Alaric, now knighted as the first human dragon rider, rose to the occasion, eager to fill the gap left by his fallen comrades.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">He took on the role of mentor, helping to train new recruits and guiding the younger squires, who looked up to him as an inspiration. Tales of his bravery during the battle at Castle Tarn had spread throughout the valley, and even the most seasoned knights respected him. Alaric’s reputation grew, as did his skill, strength and intelligence, honed through endless drills, training exercises, and occasional skirmishes against remaining bands of dark forces on the valley’s outskirts.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One day, Alaric and his fellow knights were summoned to stop a marauding band of orcs from entering through a mountain pass next to the village he grew in. As they rode into battle, Alaric felt a thrill of excitement, the familiar rush of his dragon’s wings beneath him as they soared over the forest. His sapphire-blue dragon, Vaelor, had become a trusted companion and friend, and together, they were a formidable force.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The battle was swift but fierce, with Alaric leading a group of younger knights in driving the orcs back across the valley. He fought with grace and skill, his sword flashing in the sunlight as he defended his hometown. When the fighting was done, Alaric decided to take a day to visit his adoptive family, who still lived in the village he’d left years ago. Word of his return traveled quickly, and by the time he arrived, the entire village was waiting to welcome him.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 604.80px; height: 339.25px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">As he dismounted from Vaelor, children gathered around, wide-eyed, asking him questions about dragon riding and his life as a knight. Alaric knelt, telling them tales of his journeys, showing them his sword, and even letting them touch the shimmering scales of his dragon. His parents, who had grown older but still strong, embraced him tightly, pride and joy shining in their eyes.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image29.jpg" style="width: 537.60px; height: 298.98px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">That night, the village celebrated with a feast in Alaric’s honor. They roasted wild boar, caught fresh fish, and prepared baskets of fruit and bread. Barrels of cider and wine were opened, and villagers sang songs, played music, and danced in celebration under the stars. Alaric shared laughter and stories with his old friends, and his childhood friend Guinevere sat beside him, smiling warmly as they reminisced about their shared past.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" style="width: 537.60px; height: 355.57px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">During a quiet moment, Guinevere handed Alaric a simple but beautiful crown made from the village’s wildflowers. “I made this for you,” she said, with an affectionate tone. “To remind you that no matter how far you go, you’ll always be part of this village.” Alaric accepted the crown with a smile, touched by the gesture.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image9.jpg" style="width: 480.00px; height: 480.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The next morning, he prepared to leave, but his family and the villagers gathered to bid him farewell. His mother clasped his hands tightly, reminding him to stay safe, and his father gave him a strong and warm embrace. Alaric mounted Vaelor and took to the skies once more, his heart full of gratitude and love for the family and village that had shaped him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Returning to the order, Alaric resumed his duties with renewed purpose. Over the years, he continued to grow, not only as a knight but as a leader. He guided younger squires, teaching them not only the art of battle but also the values that held the order together—loyalty, resilience, and honor. His bond with Vaelor deepened, and together, they became a symbol of hope and unity for the valley.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When the time came, Alaric’s efforts and dedication were recognized by his fellow knights. At the age of twenty-eight, he was named one of the three paladins, alongside the legendary knights Gawain and Percival. Galahad, the elder paladin, had decided to step down from his duties due to his advancing age, entrusting Alaric to carry on the legacy of the order.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Standing beside Gawain and Percival, Alaric felt a deep sense of honor and responsibility. He knew the path ahead would be challenging, but he was ready. With the valley under their watchful protection, he vowed to uphold the values that had guided him throughout his life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>And so, Alaric continued his journey—not only as a knight of the order but as a champion of the valley, a beacon of hope for all who looked to the skies, waiting for the day when peace would return to the Valley of Dragons.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.h9gm1c1o1l4o"><span class="c7">Chapter 9: Paladin</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric, now one of the valley’s three paladins, served alongside Gawain and Percival with unwavering dedication. Together, they formed a powerful trio, each with unique skills that strengthened the dragon rider order. Gawain, the best strategist of the three, made sure their forces were meticulously distributed, supplied and were expertly used in battle. Percival, the oldest of the three and a brilliant and diplomatic mind, excelled at forging alliances through fairness and mutual benefit and maintained a network of relationships with merchants, farmlands, human river cities, elven forests, and the dragons of the mountain caves. Alaric, with his extraordinary rise from a young orphan to a paladin, had become an inspiration to the valley’s people, uniting them in hope and pride.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dragon rider knights performed well under the trio and they grew in experience, knowledge and numbers. They successfully defeated one menace after the other but the dark overlord seemed to never run out of evil minions to attack them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">One night, Alaric had a vision of their future. In it, the order continued defending the valley but it grew complacent, passive and stagnant. Finally, they were defeated by forces of the dark god, who took over the valley and burned it completely, together with all its inhabitants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the vision, a feminine voice spoke to him, soft yet filled with ancient power. “Alaric,” she said, “if you wish to prevent this future, seek me in the forest of Faron. There lies a magic lake, hidden from the trodden path. There, you shall find the means to defeat the Dark God.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The following morning, he shared his vision with Gawain and Percival, who listened gravely. They agreed that the valley could not survive if they remained on the defensive. To end the threat once and for all, they would need to take the fight to the Dark God himself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With their counsel and support, Alaric prepared for his journey to the forest of Faron. Mounting his dragon, Vaelor, he soared above the valley and flew to the far reaches of the forest where he dismounted to search for the ancient lake hidden in the forest. As he approached, Alaric felt an unsettling stillness settle over the woods. The light grew dim, and a thick fog began to drift through the trees, as if shielding the lake from prying eyes. The voice hadn’t struck the human paladin as a force of evil, but neither as a pure force of good. He continued with faith until he was almost lost among the ominous trees.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, when his confidence was lowest, he found an opening in the forest. The lake of silvery water radiated an eerie glow, its surface perfectly still, as if waiting for his arrival. Then he heard the female voice again, this time with his own ears.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Come forward, Alaric,” she said, her voice echoing in the stillness. “I am the Lady of the Lake, older than the mountains and the rivers, older even than the dragons. You have come seeking a way to defeat the Dark God.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric nodded, his heart pounding. “Yes, Lady. I will do whatever it takes to protect the valley</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, a hand holding a sword emerged from the waters.Its blade gleamed with a light that seemed to cut through the darkness itself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“This is the Sword of the Dawn,” she said. “Forged in the fires of ancient magic, only with this weapon can you, a human, destroy the Dark God.”</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric stepped forward and wrapped his hands around the hilt, feeling a surge of power flow through him. The sword was light, yet unyielding, its edge sharp enough to cut through the very air. He felt a newfound strength, as if the sword itself had chosen him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">“Go forth, Alaric. Go to his lair in Mount Doom, complete your destiny and save the valley of dragons.” the Lady said, her voice fading as her hand returned to the lake.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image19.jpg" style="width: 93.45px; height: 360.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="" src="images/image13.jpg" style="width: 511.20px; height: 360.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric took a steadying breath, feeling the weight of his mission settle upon him. Armed with the Sword of the Dawn, he knew he had what he needed to face the Dark God.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Returning to the order, he met with Gawain and Percival. They drew up a plan to take their forces directly to the Dark God’s lair. Together, they would lead the dragon riders in a final assault to free the valley from its perdition. Alaric felt he was finally ready to face the darkness that had haunted his life since he was a child.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"/></p></div>
        
        <div class="tab"><h1 class="c0 c5" id="h.jexccz78r02s"><span class="c7">Chapter 10: Evil’s Lair</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Armed with the knowledge of the Dark God’s lair and the power of the magic sword, the paladins devised a plan for a direct assault. They rallied all their knights and issued final instructions. After several days of preparation at the Order’s headquarters, the last group arrived—returning from a skirmish against harpies that had attacked a human river city. With only a few hours of rest, the knights assembled and launched from the Order’s castle as the mightiest airborne army the valley had ever seen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They flew for two days before Mount Doom loomed into view—a solitary, towering peak of unnatural, jagged volcanic rock, sharp and black against the blood-red sky. Volcanic fumes spewed from its summit, and rivers of lava flowed down its sides, casting an ominous glow over the desolate landscape.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 416.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The land around Mount Doom was brown and barren, scarred by rivers of lava and pools of thick, black tar—a truly unholy land. The Dark God’s forces gathered in dens around lava wells, which seemed central to their life. A sizable army of demons guarded the domain, with gargoyles patrolling the skies above. The dragon riders, however, were stronger. Landing behind a ridge, Gawain used his magic to project his voice, giving last-minute orders to the knights before they lifted into the air to begin the attack.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They caught the enemy completely off guard, seizing the opportunity to inflict devastating damage. The ground forces were scattered and slow to react, while the airborne troops, still on the ground, were vulnerable as they scrambled to meet the knights. The knights pressed forward, cutting through enemy ranks with overwhelming power and speed. Their mission was clear: break through to Mount Doom, send a strike team with the three paladins through the chimney, and confront the Dark God in his throne room. Meanwhile, the remaining knights would hold back the dark forces, diverting attention from the strike team. Though they had the advantage of surprise, the enemy would rally, and reinforcements would soon arrive. Speed was crucial to secure victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dark God quickly realized the situation. With a voice full of hate, he rallied his troops, strengthening their resolve. The ground forces regrouped, mounting a fierce defense against the relentless assault of the dragon rider knights. In the skies above, gargoyles became more aggressive, and, to the dragon riders’ shock, an unexpected foe emerged—a squadron of dark dragon rider knights appeared from behind Mount Doom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The knights faced a twisted reflection of themselves, corrupted by the Dark God’s power. For evil cannot create; it can only distort what is forged by good. These dark knights proved formidable, yet their vile imitation strengthened the resolve of the dragon riders. The best fighters among them raced to intercept their dark counterparts, engaging in epic aerial duels of blade and magic above the battlefield.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The knights’ attack lost momentum due to the intervention of the dark knights and several dragon rider knights were lost. To make matters worse, enemy reinforcements appeared on the horizon. Nevertheless, the dragon rider knights pressed onward, finally reaching Mount Doom, but then the Dark God played another vile trick. A massive fire tornado erupted from the volcano, spiraling higher and intensifying until walls of fire rendered the peak unreachable. The tornado’s fierce rotation even stirred the clouds above, generating a hurricane that swirled over the battlefield.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image31.jpg" style="width: 480.00px; height: 480.22px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The dragon riders were battered by the fury of the firestorm, forcing them to halt their advance. Chaos erupted among their ranks as they fought to hold off the enemy without a clear plan. Then Alaric had an idea: the strike team, led by the three paladins, needed to fly higher, ascending until they broke through the clouds. From there, they could dive into the storm’s eye—its calmest point—entering directly into the chimney of Mount Doom.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image16.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 273.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="" src="images/image36.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 249.33px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric opened his mind, allowing Paladin Gawain to read his plan. Gawain understood instantly, relaying the orders to the others through his powerful telepathic magic. The three paladins and their strike team quickly assembled and began ascending. Enemy gargoyles and dark knights attempted to intercept them, but the other dragon rider knights intercepted these foes, knowing that covering the strike team was their only hope for victory.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">With great effort, the strike team climbed higher, finally breaking through the cold, wet clouds. Above, the sky was peaceful, free from the firestorm, the battle, and even the Dark God’s presence. Flying horizontally at top speed, they soon spotted the eye of the storm. Wind funneled into the storm’s calm center, and together they dove straight into it. The vertical tunnel led them through the fiery tornado, then down into the dark, rocky chimney of Mount Doom—finally arriving at the magma chamber below.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image27.jpg" style="width: 604.80px; height: 228.69px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><img alt="" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 604.80px; height: 257.04px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the center of the chamber lay a natural rock platform, connected by a narrow bridge to an entrance carved into the wall. A guard of demons and their hell-wolves blocked the way, but they fell quickly to the knights’ attack. The twelve landed on the platform and proceeded on foot through the stone entrance carved with ominous runes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Alaric led the way, the Sword of the Dawn lighting their path as they ventured deeper into the Dark God’s lair. The corridors were cold, silent, and filled with shadows that seemed to move on their own. Moving cautiously, they slowed their pace, advancing methodically to avoid traps or surprise encounters with demon patrols. Their careful progress allowed them to dispatch two patrols as they ventured deeper into the lair. The Dark God’s ego was unmistakable: every corridor pointed directly to the corrupted throne, making the path all too clear.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Finally, the twelve knights entered the throne hall of the Dark God, moving with utmost caution. There he was, seated on a throne of black and red jagged volcanic stone, exuding an aura of pure evil, hatred, and cruelty. Around him stood his elite guard—not demons, but specters of former human kings from distant lands, corrupted and enslaved by the Dark God in past conquests. Cloaked in shadows, these spectral guards wielded long swords and daggers that flickered with cold, dark magic.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dark God rose, his voice a chilling whisper that filled the room. “You dare to challenge me in my own domain?” he hissed, his gaze settling on Alaric. “No mortal has ever faced me and lived.”</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 604.80px; height: 362.88px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The knights formed a bow-shaped formation with the three paladins at the center. The Dark God rose, and with his spectral guard, charged forward. The battle began, fierce and relentless, with every strike echoing through the chamber. The specters fought with unnatural strength, their strikes chilling the air around them, but the paladins fought as one, their coordination and resolve unbreakable. Each step was calculated, every inch hard-won. Outnumbered by the spectral kings, the knights relied on their skill—and the strength of fighting for a noble cause.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dark God was by far the most powerful combatant, requiring several knights just to hold him at bay. Yet, the twelve dragon rider knights pressed on, gaining ground inch by inch. Two of the specter kings fell, their forms dissolving into empty cloaks on the ground, leaving an eerie silence in their wake.</span></p><br><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 604.80px; height: 277.12px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""/><br><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The Dark Lord retreated to the second row and raised his left hand, casting a spell that drained the light from the room. An oppressive energy filled the air, distracting the knights and giving the enemy the upper hand for a moment. Then, with a fierce gesture, he clenched his fist as if charging it with seething rage and pointed toward the knights, releasing a torrent of fire in a sweeping cone. One specter enemy but also knights Bors and Geraint were incinerated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Reacting swiftly, Paladin Percival conjured a powerful wind shield, deflecting the flames away from the remaining knights. As the Dark God ceased his spell, the battle resumed with renewed fury. Though revengeful by the loss of two of their best, the knights fought on without losing their temper and assaulted their enemies even more boldly. Several more specter kings fell, their ranks thinned by the knights’ relentless assault.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Occasional dark spells flew through the chamber, but the knights advanced, cornering their enemies against the throne. The Dark God, fierce and unyielding, grew more dangerous, fighting with a final, desperate intensity. Now the three paladins—Gawain, Percival, and Alaric—focused their efforts on him, while the remaining knights held off the spectral kings.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In a split second, the Dark God sidestepped to his right, seizing the chance to kill knight Caradoc, who had made the fatal error of turning his back while battling a specter king. Percival saw an opening and slashed down at the Dark Lord’s right hand, but the enemy parried, deflecting Percival’s sword to the side and swiftly driving his own blade deep into the paladin’s chest. Percival fell lifeless to the ground.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Furious, Gawain and Alaric unleashed a flurry of powerful strikes, forcing the Dark Lord—still off-balance from his attack—to retreat up the steps to his throne. Gawain delivered a masterful strike, causing the Dark Lord’s black sword to falter for an instant. Alaric seized the opportunity and lunged at the enemy. With a fierce thrust, he drove the Sword of the Dawn deep into the Dark God’s chest and continued pushing with fury until the dark god sat on his throne with the Sword of the Dawn sticking out of his dead body.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The specter kings vanished, leaving only their long swords and black cloaks behind—but not their daggers. Outside, the fire tornado dissipated, the storm calmed, and the Dark God’s forces either escaped from this world or fled in terror. Alaric had defeated the Dark God and fulfilled his destiny. Rid of evil, peace could finally return to the world, and the knights could go home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c13">The End</span></p></div>
